# Predicting-booking-cancellations

This data set contains a single file which compares various booking information between two hotels: a city hotel and a resort hotel. Both hotels are located in Portugal (southern Europe). The data contains "bookings due to arrive between the 1st of July of 2015 and the 31st of August 2017".

Today, many hotels are trying to categorize their customers such as their needs, wants, characteristics in order to approach them in the most effective way.
In data analysis, this can be possible by clustering clients with unsupervised machine learning algorithms.

Another challenge for hotels is to be able to identify in advance customers who are going to cancel their reservation. By knowing this information, they can better plan personel and food requirements for instance.

We will follow this process:
- Data cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis
- Unsupervised learning - clustering booking clients
- Supervised learning - predicting cancellations
- Summary
